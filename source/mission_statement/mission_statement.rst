Mission Statement
=================
 
With our company love for our services, we strive to bring all 
customers the best products and assistance for their vehicle needs. 


Our company started in the summer of 2017 and continues to make 
great improvements. We are a team started by friends in Indianola, 
Iowa based off a random idea. We provide all types of services to 
our customers including repairing, detailing and selling. The owners 
of our company and locations are Riley, Cole and Chris. 


Our team is professional, fun, and we believe friendly employees 
are the secret to our success. Our dealership is different because 
our employees truly enjoy a long average tenure at the dealership 
and enjoy working in a family like  environment. The passion and 
dedication that each employee invests is a key component to the 
overall dealership success and what keeps our loyal customers 
coming back each time.
