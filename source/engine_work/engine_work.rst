Engine Replacements
===================

What Will Factor The Cost
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are many things that are going to be considered when it comes to 
the price of the engine replacement. You are going to need to know if you 
will need a new long, short block, or even the whole engine. Having something 
brand new that is coming from the storage will cost so much more than grabbing one 
from a junkyard. Newer engines are also going to factor into the cost because 
the newer it is the more expensive it'll be. Another thing is where you will be getting 
it replaced. Here at RCC we offer reasonable prices and we also can finance your 
engine replacement. 


* **New Engine Replacement - $1500 - 2500**
* **Labor Cost - $35-50 an hour**

We do not give packages with our engine replacement because we need to assess 
the condition of your engine before we come up with a price. The good thing with 
that is that here at RCC dealership is that we give free assessments and even a 
free car wash with the assessment. We care about our customers cars and always want 
them to the standard of excellence. Here are some links to local junkyards if prices 
are too expensive for us. We can install those for you as well for a price of $800.
