Paintshop
=========

**Wellâ€¦ you got your ride!**

You just bought your new car and you are ready to 
drive it off the lot.  What about a new paint job? We can do many things when it
comes to your cars paint.  This can be just a solid color if you do not like 
your current color.  This could be Pokka dots, pin stripes, flames, 
multi-colored, or any other color combination you could think of.  If you can 
design it, our shop can paint it.  

* Our specialized Designs:
   * Pokka Dots
   * Stripes
   * Super Fly Flames

We will do our best when it comes to specialized designs.  We will 
communicate with the customer to figure out exactly what is wanted.  Depending 
on the time taken, billable hours might increase or decrease.  This is non-
negotiable, and is in the billing when you sign up for "custom made paint job."
Depending on how extensive the design is, we estimate 5-10 hours per job.  This 
is based on previous jobs and we always ask our experts when billing or bidding
on a Custom Paint Job.
