Rims
====

We carry 3 different brands of car rims, but we do not carry any motorcycle rims.
The reason we do not carry motorcycle rims is because we do not have as many
bikes as we do cars at our dealership and it is not cost effective. The three 
different brands we carry are ASA, American Racing and KMC. These three brands 
have a large variety of rims available.

We do carry a wide variety of each brand below.

These rims do not come with any kind of warranty. With that being said there is no
return policy once you have used the items. This means once they are put on your car
and you drive around with them you can not return them. They have to be in unused
condition and their are no exceptions.

We also can install these on the cars we have in stock when you buy through us.
