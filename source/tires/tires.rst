*Tires*
=======

We highly recommend Bridgestone tires for both our cars and motorcycles. We carry 
a small, but elite number of tires at our dealership. For our cars we tend to carry 
only All Season and for our motorcycles we have sport tires.

The reason we only have All Season ties for our cars is that we believe its the 
best because we don't have to constantly change tires throughout the year. It's 
the most cost effective effect option. You don't need the high performance tires 
on your cars unless you are street racing and we do not support illegal activities.

For our motorcycles we only keep in stock sport bike tires because the only bikes 
we keep at our store are those types of bikes. The right tire on the right bike 
makes a tremendous difference.

The tires below are the best tires you can get and we highly encourage you to 
get due to safety reasons.

Car tires have a minimum warranty of 20,000 miles and motorcycle tires come with 
a minimum warranty of 1,000 miles. We stand behind our products because we believe
they are superior to others.
