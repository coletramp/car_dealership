The super sport bikes are made and designed for speed and tight corners. They are the 
ideal bike for aggressive positioning and track days.

Starting off with the super sport bikes we have the R1M with a base price of $22,999. 
It features a fully carbon fiber body and a 998cc liquid-cooled inline 4 cylinder 
engine. It's a 6-speed transmission with 200 horsepower and 83 foot pounds of torque. 
This super bike can hit speeds of over 190 mph.

The second super bike we have here is the R1. The R1 has a base price of $16,699. 
It has almost everything identical to its brother the R1M except its made of steal 
and plastic instead of carbon fiber. So it also features a 998cc liquid-cooled 
inline 4 cylinder engine with a 6 speed transmission. It's pushing out the same 
200 horsepower and 83 foot pounds of torque but can only get up to about 175 mph.

The third bike in our lineup is the R6. The R6 has a base price of $12,199. Its 
has a 599cc liquid-cooled inline 4-cylinder. Even though the R6 has a much smaller 
engine it still has a 6-speed transmission. This sport bike is kicking out around 
120 horsepower and 50 foot pounds of torque. Even though its not as quick as the 
R1 and R1M it can still reach speeds of 160 mph.

The hyper naked bikes are made for more around town fun with a similar feel or a 
super sport but not as aggressive, but still want some power.

The first hyper naked bike we have is the MT-10. The base price of this bike is 
$12,999. The MT-10 has a 998cc, liquid-cooled DOHC inline 4-cylinder identical 
engine to the R1 and R1m but since the stile is not as slick it has less top end. 
It also has a 6-speed transmission. This bike has 150 horsepower and about 85 
foot pounds of torque with a top speed of 150 mph.

The second hyper naked bike we have is the MT-09. The base price of this bike is 
$8,999. This bike features a 847cc liquid-cooled inline 3 cylinder with a 6-speed 
transmission. This 3 cylinder bike has 115 horsepower and 65 foot pounds of torque. 
This bike has a top speed of 130 mph.

The last hyper naked bike we have is the MT-07. This little guy has a base price 
of $7,599. It features a 689cc liquid-cooled 4-stroke with a 6-speed transmission. 
It has 74 horsepower and 50 foot pounds of torque. Even though this little guy only 
has one cylinder he can still hit speeds of around 100 mph.
