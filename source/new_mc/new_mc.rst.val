[CSE] Warning number 1:
Possibly misspelled words (11, 3 unique): DOHC (1x), YFZ
(3x), MT (7x). Complete list. 529 total words checked (0 in
comments).

[CSE] Message number 1:
[132] Assuming an omitted "head" start tag before this start
tag. For better structure, it is recommended to explicitly
start all "head" elements with an explicit start tag. The
omitted "head" start tag should probably be placed right
before this start tag.

[CSE] Message number 2:
[132] Assuming an omitted "body" start tag before this start
tag. For better structure, it is recommended to explicitly
start all "body" elements with an explicit start tag. The
omitted "body" start tag should probably be placed right
before this start tag.

[CSE] Message number 3:
[132] Assuming an omitted "html" start tag before this start
tag. For better structure, it is recommended to explicitly
start all "html" elements with an explicit start tag. The
omitted "html" start tag should probably be placed right
before this start tag.

[CSE] Warning number 2 in line 1:1:
[32] No title was found. In most situations, the document
should be given a title by using the "title" element in the
document's "head" section. HTML 4.01 and XHTML require
exactly one "title" element for each document. Note that
HTML5 allows the "title" element to be omitted when the
title is provided by a higher-level protocol, like the
subject line of an e-mail message when HTML is used as the
email format, or when the document is an "iframe srcdoc"
document.

[CSE] Warning number 3 in line 1:1:
[24] A document type declaration should appear as the first
line (line 1) of every HTML document. For example, for HTML5
documents use <!DOCTYPE html>. For HTML 4.01 Strict
documents use <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML
4.01//EN" "https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">. For
HTML 4.01 Transitional documents, use <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC
"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
"https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">. Although HTML
recommendations generally require this line, most browsers
probably ignore it. If you're using HTML Validator's
integrated editor, then this can be added from the 'Tags'
menu or from the HTML Inserter.

[CSE] Warning number 4 in line 1:1:
Not using a DOCTYPE will likely trigger quirks mode in
browsers. If possible, quirks mode should be avoided in
favor of standards mode. Visit
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode for more
information about quirks mode. Note that the recommended
DOCTYPE to use now is HTML5, which is simply <!DOCTYPE
html>.

[CSE] Warning number 5 in line 1:1:
No title was found in this "head" section. Each page on a
site should have its own unique (never duplicated) title.
Every title should contain appropriate keywords and search
terms that are relevant to the page. Don't just stuff
keywords in the title. The first words in the title are more
likely to result in higher rankings than subsequent words,
so use important keywords at the very beginning when
reasonable. The title should also be something that a user
will want to click on when it's listed on a search engine. A
good title is also important when a visitor bookmarks a
page.

[CSE] Message number 4 in line 1:1:
A meta tag specifying the charset encoding was not found
within this document's "head" section. This could pose a
problem if the document is served locally or not served via
HTTP with an HTTP header that specifies the encoding.
Consider specifying the encoding in a meta tag. An example
"meta" tag for HTML5 documents is (if possible, place this
immediately after the "head" start-tag): <meta
charset="utf-8">

[128] Assuming an omitted "head" end tag before this start
tag. A previous "head" start tag (in line 1 [an implied
tag]) does not have an end tag or the end tag (</head>) is
in the wrong place. For better structure, it is recommended
to explicitly end all "head" elements with an end tag. The
omitted "</head>" end tag should probably be placed right
before this start tag.

   2: ===========================
   3: 
   4: Here at our dealership we also sell top of the line Yamaha motorcycles. With that
   5: being said they will be split into two categories and within those three categories
   6: they will all have sub categories.
   7: 
   8: ===========  ===========
   9: SUPER SPORT  HYPER NAKED
  10: ===========  ===========
  11: YFZ-R1M      MT-10
  12: YFZ-R1       MT-09
  13: YFZ-R6       MT-07
  14: ===========  ===========
  15: 
  16: The super sport bikes are made and designed for speed and tight corners. They are the 
  17: ideal bike for aggressive positioning and track days.
  18: 
  19: Starting off with the super sport bikes we have the R1M with a base price of $22,999. 
  20: It features a fully carbon fiber body and a 998cc liquid-cooled inline 4 cylinder 
  21: engine. It's a 6-speed transmission with 200 horsepower and 83 foot pounds of torque. 
  22: This super bike can hit speeds of over 190 mph.
  23: 
  24: The second super bike we have here is the R1. The R1 has a base price of $16,699. 
  25: It has almost everything identical to its brother the R1M except its made of steal 
  26: and plastic instead of carbon fiber. So it also features a 998cc liquid-cooled 
  27: inline 4 cylinder engine with a 6 speed transmission. It's pushing out the same 
  28: 200 horsepower and 83 foot pounds of torque but can only get up to about 175 mph.
  29: 
  30: The third bike in our lineup is the R6. The R6 has a base price of $12,199. Its 
  31: has a 599cc liquid-cooled inline 4-cylinder. Even though the R6 has a much smaller 
  32: engine it still has a 6-speed transmission. This sport bike is kicking out around 
  33: 120 horsepower and 50 foot pounds of torque. Even though its not as quick as the 
  34: R1 and R1M it can still reach speeds of 160 mph.
  35: 
  36: The hyper naked bikes are made for more around town fun with a similar feel or a 
  37: super sport but not as aggressive, but still want some power.
  38: 
  39: The first hyper naked bike we have is the MT-10. The base price of this bike is 
  40: $12,999. The MT-10 has a 998cc, liquid-cooled DOHC inline 4-cylinder identical 
  41: engine to the R1 and R1m but since the stile is not as slick it has less top end. 
  42: It also has a 6-speed transmission. This bike has 150 horsepower and about 85 
  43: foot pounds of torque with a top speed of 150 mph.
  44: 
  45: The second hyper naked bike we have is the MT-09. The base price of this bike is 
  46: $8,999. This bike features a 847cc liquid-cooled inline 3 cylinder with a 6-speed 
  47: transmission. This 3 cylinder bike has 115 horsepower and 65 foot pounds of torque. 
  48: This bike has a top speed of 130 mph.
  49: 
  50: The last hyper naked bike we have is the MT-07. This little guy has a base price 
  51: of $7,599. It features a 689cc liquid-cooled 4-stroke with a 6-speed transmission. 
  52: It has 74 horsepower and 50 foot pounds of torque. Even though this little guy only 
  53: has one cylinder he can still hit speeds of around 100 mph.

Accessibility checking is off. This program can help you
make your web pages more accessible. An accessible page is
one that more individuals can use, such as individuals who
are blind or deaf. It can also increase the usefulness of
your web page for individuals who browse the web using
slower devices like older computers or wireless devices like
mobile phones and PDAs. An accessible web site makes good
business sense (and possibly good legal sense as well) and
may even improve search engine rankings. You can enable or
disable accessibility checking in the Validator Engine
Options.

[133] Mobility Tip #2 - Limit or avoid unnecessary
JavaScript animations that can slow things down and increase
battery consumption. Consider CSS animations instead (but
they'll be ignored on browsers that don't support them).

[CSE] Comment number 8:
<meta name="description" content="(actual description)">
should be used in the "head" section to provide a brief
description of what is contained on this page. Although
descriptions may not be used directly for rankings, search
engines may display descriptions in search results, with
bolding of the relevent keywords. Therefore, a good
description can help boost click-through rates and thus
increase traffic to a website. If you're using HTML
Validator's integrated editor, then this can be added from
the 'Tags' menu or from the HTML Inserter.

[CSE] Comment number 9:
No "h1" or "h2" heading element was found. Using these
heading elments (especially "h1" and preferably with your
best keywords) to describe sub-topics of a page may improve
search engine rankings. If "h1" text is too large then you
can reduce its size with CSS.

[CSE] Comment number 10:
No italicizing, emphasizing, bolding, or strong tags were
used. Emphasizing or italicizing keywords (with the "em"
element) may improve rankings. Similarly, using strong text
or bolding keywords (with the "strong" element) may also
improve rankings.

[CSE] Comment number 11:
[113] Random Search Engine Tip #23 - USE SHORTER URLs.
Shorter URLs may perform better in search results and are
more likely to be copied & pasted, linked-to, and shared.
